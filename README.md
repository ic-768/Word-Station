# Word Station
Use case:
Sometimes I read literary books with weird words in them. I might google them, go "aha", and **think** that I've learnt them. But too many times I've ended up reading the same word a few months later with no clue of what it means - because it's so rare I've forgotten it.

This project allows the user to create an account and search for any word they want, just like googling it. The app will show a complete list of definitions, synonyms, and antonyms. They can then 'favorite' the word and add it to their word list.

At any time, they can check out their list, and review any of their favorited words to refresh their memory.

The idea is that with repetition and seeing the word and its definition over and over again, it should stick.

A flash-card mode is in development to make the learning process more fun!

Built with NextJS, TypeScript, and Tailwind.
