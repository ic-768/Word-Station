# Word Station
Use case:
Sometimes I read literary books with weird words in them. I might google them, go "aha", and *think* that I've learnt them. But too many times I've ended up reading the same word a few months later with no clue of what it means.

This project allows the user to create an account and search for any word they want. The app will show a complete list of definitions, synonyms, and antonyms. They can then 'favorite' the word and add it to their word list.

From their list they can review any of their favorited words in order to refresh their memory. The idea is that with repetition and seeing the word and its definition over and over again, it should stick.

A flash-card mode is in development to make the learning process more fun!

Built with **NextJS, TypeScript, and Tailwind**.

## Live Demo:
https://word-station.vercel.app/

**Demo credentials**:\
Username: 'user@domain.com'\
Password: 'testy6'

If the login credentials don't work I probably need to restart my PostGresDB instance - it freezes automatically when it's been inactive for too long.


## Running the app locally:
Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
